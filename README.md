# phodupe

## What is it

A simple little python script that finds duplicate file names (without the extension) across two directories and gives the user the option to delete them.

## Why

I used this as an opportunity to begin learning python. It was created for a very very specific scenario and might not be too useful to anyone else.

## How do to install / run

(There are probobly better ways to run this, but i'm a python noob)

- Navigate to the folder you downloaded the git project to
  - cd \development\git\Phodupe\
- Install the python script
  - python .\setup.py install
- Run the script by passing two directories
  - python phodupe "C:\Users\NYPD\Desktop\OG Phone Walls" "C:\Users\NYPD\Desktop\2Delete"
